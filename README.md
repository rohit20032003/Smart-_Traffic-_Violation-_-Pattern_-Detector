# Smart Traffic Violation Detection System


This project is a Python-based system that automatically detects traffic rule violations using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
It analyzes video footage or live camera feeds to identify common violations such as triple riding, helmetless driving, signal jumping, or wrong-lane usage.

## Introduction
This project aims to utilize machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect traffic rule violations, specifically focusing on helmet detection. The system captures live or recorded video footage from surveillance cameras, processes it using trained models, and automatically identifies violations. Once detected, the system can notify concerned authorities for further action such as issuing fines or warnings.

## Objectives
- To design and train a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying traffic rule violations.
- automate the violation monitoring and fine management process, reducing manual effort and improving efficiency.
## Features
- An interactive interface for viewing, tracking, and managing detected violations.
- An automated alert and reporting system that assists authorities in fine collection.
- Real-time detection with visual evidence for verification..

## Technologies & Libraries Used
- Python – for system implementation and integration.
- YOLOv5 and OpenCV – for real-time object detection and helmet recognition.
- OCR / ALPR APIs – for automatic license plate identification.
- Tkinter – for building a simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).
